Changelog
=========

These are all the changes in Lektor since the first public release.

2.0
---

Next feature release

- Added `_discoverable` system field which controls if a page should show
  up in `children`.  The default is that a page is discoverable.  Setting it
  to `False` means in practical terms that someone needs to know the URL as
  all collection operations will not return it.
- Added `for_page` function to pagination that returns the pagiantion for a
  specific page.
- Make pagination next_page and prev_page be None on the edges.
- Allow plugins to provide publishers.
- Added `|markdown` filter.
- Added French translations.
- Unicode filenames as final build artifacts are now explicitly disallowed.
- Serve up a 404.html as an error page in the dev server.
- Improvements to the path normalization and alt handling.  This should support
  URL generation in more complex cases between alts now.
- Show a clearer error message when URL generation fails because a source
  object is virtual (does not have a path).
- Empty text is now still valid markdown.
- Lektor clean now loads the plugins as well.
- Basic support for type customization.

Release date to be decided

- Fixed an error that caused unicode characters in the project
  name to be mishandled in the quickstart.
- Do not create empty folders when the quickstart skips over files.
- Empty values for the slug field now pull in the default.
- Corrected a bug in hashing in the FTP publisher that could cause
  files to not upload correctly.
- Improved error message for when imagemagick cannot be found.
- Fixed scrolling in the admin for firefox and some other browsers.

1.1

Released on 27th of December 2015

- Fixed a bug where resolving URL paths outside of alts did not
  fall back to asset resolving.
- verbose mode now correctly displays traceback of build failures.
- Fixed a bug that caused build failures not to be remembered.
- Fixed a bad EXIF attribute (longitude was misspelt)
- Use requests for URL fetching instead of urllib.  This should fix
  some SSL errors on some Python versions.
- Parent of page now correctly resolves to the right alt.
- Publish from a temporary folder on the same device which solves
  problems on machines with `/tmp` on a different drive.
