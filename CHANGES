2.0
---

Released on 11th of April 2016

- Added `_discoverable` system field which controls if a page should show
  up in `children`.  The default is that a page is discoverable.  Setting it
  to `False` means in practical terms that someone needs to know the URL as
  all collection operations will not return it.

  specific page.
- Make pagination next_page and prev_page be None on the edges.

- Improvements to the path normalization and alt handling.  This should support
  URL generation in more complex cases between alts now.
- Show a clearer error message when URL generation fails because a source
  object is virtual (does not have a path).
- Empty text is now still valid markdown.
- Lektor clean now loads the plugins as well.
- Basic support for type customization.
- Fields that are absent in a content file from an alternative are now pulled
  from the primary content file.
- Development server now resolves index.html for assets as well.
- Markdown processing now correctly adjusts links relative to where the
  rendered output is rendered.
- Added Dutch translations.
- Added Record.get_siblings()

  can be used by publishers to affect the processing.
- The thumbnails will now always have the correct width and height set
  as an attribute.
- added datetime type
- added support for the process_image utility functions so that plugins
  can use it directly.

- added Spanish translations.
- added Japanese translations.
- added support for discovering existing alts of sources.
- added support for image cropping.
- added preliminary support for publishing on windows.
- children and attachments can now have a hidden flag configured explicitly.
  Attachments will also no longer inherit the hidden flag of the parent
  record as that is not a sensible default.
- changed internal sqlite consistency mode to improve performance on HDDs.
- allow SVG files to be treated as images.  This is something that does not
  work in all situations yet (in particular thumbnailing does not actually
  do anything for those)
