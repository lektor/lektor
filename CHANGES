=========

Next feature release

- Added `_discoverable` system field which controls if a page should show
  up in `children`.  The default is that a page is discoverable.  Setting it
  to `False` means in practical terms that someone needs to know the URL as
  all collection operations will not return it.
- Added `for_page` function to pagination that returns the pagiantion for a
  specific page.
- Make pagination next_page and prev_page be None on the edges.
- Allow plugins to provide publishers.
- Added `|markdown` filter.
- Added French translations.

Bugfix release

- Fixed a bug where resolving URL paths outside of alts did not
  fall back to asset resolving.
- verbose mode now correctly displays traceback of build failures.
- Fixed a bug that caused build failures not to be remembered.
- Fixed a bad EXIF attribute (longitude was misspelt)
- Use requests for URL fetching instead of urllib.  This should fix
  some SSL errors on some Python versions.
- Parent of page now correctly resolves to the right alt.
- Publish from a temporary folder on the same device which solves
  problems on machines with `/tmp` on a different drive.
