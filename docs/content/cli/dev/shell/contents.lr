`lektor dev shell`

Starts a Python shell in the context of a Lektor project.

This is particularly useful for debugging plugins and to explore the
API.  To quit the shell just use `quit()`.  Within the shell various
utilities are available right from the get-go for you.

- `env`: an environment for the loaded project.
- `pad`: a database pad initialized for the project and environment
  that is ready to use.
