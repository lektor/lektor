`lektor plugins reinstall`

Forces a re-installation of all plugins.  This will download the
requested versions of the plugins and install them into the plugin
cache folder.  Alternatively one can just use `flush-cache` to
flush the cache and on next build Lektor will automatically download
the plugins again.
