`lektor server`

The server command will launch a local server for development.

Lektor's developemnt server will automatically build all files into
pages similar to how the build command with the `--watch` switch
works, but also at the same time serve up the website on a local
HTTP server.

## Options

- `-h, --host TEXT`: The network interface to bind to.  The default is the
  loopback device, but by setting it to 0.0.0.0 it becomes available on
  all network interfaces.
- `-p, --port INTEGER`: The port to bind to.
- `-O, --output-path PATH`: The dev server will build into the same folder
  as the build command by default.
- `-v, --verbose`: Increases the verbosity of the logging.
- `-f, --build-flag TEXT`: Defines an arbitrary build flag.  These can be
  used by plugins to customize the build process.  More information can be
  found in the documentation of affected plugins.
- `--help`: print this help page.
