title: record

summary: A reference to the current source record.

type: property

body:

This works almost exactly like the [source :ref](../source/) property but the
difference is that it is `None` if the source object is not a
[Record :ref](../../../db/record/).

## Example

```python
from lektor.context import get_ctx

ctx = get_ctx()
print ctx.record.record_label
```
