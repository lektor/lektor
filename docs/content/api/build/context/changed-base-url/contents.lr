summary: Can override the base URL that is used for relative URL generation.

body:

By default the URL generation is relative to the current source record
but in some cases this can lead to issues when plugins attempt more complex
operations.  In these cases the base URL can temporarily be overridden
with this method.

## Example

```python
with get_ctx().changed_base_url('/downloads/'):
    url = url_to('/')
```
