summary: A reference to the source object if available.

type: property

body:

If an artifact directly corresponds to a [Source Object :ref](../../../db/obj/)
then this will be a reference to it.  For most plugins this is unlikely but
if you provide a source obj in the `sub_artifact` call it will be available
here.
