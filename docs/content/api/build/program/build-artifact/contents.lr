summary: Invoked to build a previously declared artifact.

type: method

body:

This method is invoked for previously declared artifacts and is supposed to
write out the artifact.  It's only invoked if the builder decided that the
artifact is outdated based on the information at hand.

For an example refer to the [add_build_program
:ref](../../../environment/add-build-program/) documentation.
