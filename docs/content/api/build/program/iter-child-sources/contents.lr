title: iter_child_sources
---
type: method
---
summary: Optionally this method can be implemented to produce child sources.
---
body:

Optionally a builder can yield further sources that are then picked up by the
builder and processed normally.  This is how the recursive build process in
Lektor is implemented for normal records.

## Example

```python
def iter_child_sources(self):
    for child in self.sources.children:
        yield child
```
