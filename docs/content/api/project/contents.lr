body:

The project class is one of the most basic classes that Lektor uses to
implement its building process.  It's generated very early on when the
application needs to interact with the project file on disk.  This
class is mostly useful for building scripts that use the Lektor API and
not so much in other situations as it's not directly playing a role in
the main build process.
