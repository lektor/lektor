title: load_plugins
---
type: method

summary: Loads the available plugins for the environment.
---
body:

Normally when an environment is constructed plugins are loaded automatically.
If you disabled this when creating the environment you can still at a later
point load the plugins by invoking this method.

## Example

```python
from lektor.project import Project

project = Project.discover()
env = project.make_env(load_plugins=False)
env.load_plugins()
```
