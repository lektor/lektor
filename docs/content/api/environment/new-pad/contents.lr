type: method

summary: Creates a brand new database pad.
---
body:

To access the [Database :ref](../../db/) from an environment you need to
first construct a [Pad :ref](../../db/pad/).  This method can do that for
you.  For more information about how the pad works, you can refer to the
general documentation of it.

## Example

```python
from lektor.project import Project

project = Project.discover()
env = project.make_env()
pad = env.new_pad()
root_record = pad.root
```
