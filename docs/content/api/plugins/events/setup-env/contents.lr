summary: Emitted right after the plugin is associated with the environment.
---
body:

This event is emitted right after the plugin was initialized and associated
with the [environment :ref](../../../environment/).  This can be used to
reconfigure it.  For instance this is the perfect place to inject Jinja 2
filters and global variables.

## Example

```python
def on_setup_env(self, **extra):
    self.env.jinja_env.globals['my_variable'] = 'my value'
```
