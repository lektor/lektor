body:

This attribute holds the path to the folder where the build process put the
final artifacts.  Usually a publisher walks that folder and does something
with all contents of it.  The publishers however are heavily encouraged to
ignore the special `.lektor` folder which contains lektor specific information
that should not end up on the resulting server.
