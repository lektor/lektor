summary: The parent object for this source object.

type: property

body:

For most source objects it's possible to discover their parents through
this property.  It's not a requirement that this property is implemented but
most will have it.  In particular it's useful for virtual source objects
where this property can be used to discover the associated parent object.

## Example

```html+jinja
<p>My parent is: {{ this.parent.path }}
```
