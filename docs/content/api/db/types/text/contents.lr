The `text` type is very similar to the [string :ref:](../string/) type but
can store multiple lines.  It does not support any formatting but is very
useful for storing code and other things.

It renders as a multi-line input field in the admin interface.

```ini
[fields.code]
label = Code
type = text
```

## Template Usage

```html+jinja
<pre>{{ this.code }}</pre>
```
