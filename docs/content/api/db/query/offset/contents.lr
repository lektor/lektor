body:

The offset method can be used to skip a certain number of items.  Typically
this is not useful as pagination comes built-in, but it can be helpful in
some manual scenarios when working with data from the `shell`.

This is typically combined with [limit :ref](../limit/).

## Example

```pycon
>>> pad.query('/projects').limit(5).offset(10).all()
[...]
```
