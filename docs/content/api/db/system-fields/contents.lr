title: System Fields
---
summary: The complete list of system fields in Lektor
---
body:

All records have a few system fields available in addition to the fields
defined by the data model.  These fields are always there and control internal
behavior in Lektor.  They are prefixed by an underscore to separate them
from the fields a model defines.

Many system fields are hidden from the admin panel but some can be changed
there (`_template`, `_hidden`, and a few others).
