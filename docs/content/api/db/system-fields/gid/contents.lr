body:

The `_gid` is the MD5 hashed version of the page's [`_path`](../path/).  This
is useful in situations where a stable ID is needed that follows a certain
format.  For instance it can come in useful when a ID is needed for a DOM
element.

## Example

```html+jinja
<body class="page-{{ this._gid }}">
...
</body>
```
