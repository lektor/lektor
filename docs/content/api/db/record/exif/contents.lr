body:

This property gives access to some of the EXIF information that might be
embedded in the picture.  Not all pictures might contain that information
and some information might be unavailable.  In those cases the attribute
will be `null`.

In addition the `to_dict()` method can be used to convert the EXIF data
into a dictionary that can be dumped to JSON for instance.
