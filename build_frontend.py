"""A hatch build-hook that builds the front-end js/css at PEP 517 build time.

By default, when building the dist, if the built frontend code is not
present in the source directory, it will be built.  (Node must be installed,
or this will fail.)

Environment Variables
---------------------

There are a couple of environment variables that can be used to provide
additional control over the building of the frontend code.

- ``HATCH_BUILD_NO_HOOKS=true``: skip building the frontend code
- ``HATCH_BUILD_CLEAN=true``: force (re)building of the frontend code
