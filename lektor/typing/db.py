"""****************************************
The various kinds of DB paths and pieces
****************************************

RecordPathPart
==============

An allowed component of a RecordPath to a db record.


VirtualPathPart
===============

An allowed component of a RecordPath to a db record.


UnsafeDbPath
============

FIXME: UnsafeDbPath and UnsafeRecordPath should probably be gotten rid
of.  Just use str for unparsed values.

This is a valid first argument to Pad.get().

This is interpreted as an absolute path.  Nominally, it should start with
a leading "/", but one will be assumed if it is omitted.

Roughly the valid forms are:

    UnsafeRecordPath
    UnsafeRecordPath "@" NonNormalizedVirtualPath

Note that page numbers are never included in a UnsafeDbPath.


UnsafeRecordPath
================


This is a UnsafeDbPath that does not include an "@".  That means there is no virtual path.

Note that this may include "." and ".." in its path segments.
E.g. "/path/../whoops" is an allowed value and is equivalenet to
"/whoops".

RecordPath
==========

This is the normalized version of a UnsafeRecordPath.  It always starts with
a "/" and does not contain any "." or ".." path segments.

This is the type of Attachment.path (since attachments do not have page numbers.)

    "/" [ RecordPathPart [ "/" RecordPathPart ]* ]

VirtualPath
===========

The normalized virtual path.

    VirtualPathPart [ "/" VirtualPathPart ]*

DbPath
======

Very much like a UnsafeDbPath, expect, fully normalized.

    RecordPath [ "@" VirtualPath ]

Never includes a page number

PaginatedPath
=============

Encodes the page number (if non-None) after an "@", e.g. "/blog@2" for
the second page of the blog.  Note that the page number is not a
VirtualPath, and a PaginatedPath, therefore, is not a
UnsafeDbPath. (Pad.get("/blog@2") does not work.  Rather, you must use
Pad.get("/blog", page_num=2) for that.)

    RecordPath "@" <page_num>

UnsafeRelativeDbPath
====================

FIXME: just use str

A relative version of UnsafeDbPath.  The rules for joining an UnsafeRelativeDbPath
to an (absolute) UnsafeDbPath are a bit strange, owing to the possibility of
virtual paths, etc.  See lektor.utils.join_path.

============

URL relative to the project base_path.  This is the type of SourceObject.url_path.
